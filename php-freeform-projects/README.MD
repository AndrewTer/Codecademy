### World Traveler
Hello there, friend! We’re exhausted having just returned to New York City from a whirlwind of world travel. We’re bringing all our international currency to the bank to be exchanged for USD. Our travels have made us wise and weary, and we want to ensure we’re being treated fairly. Can you help?

Write a program to calculate exactly how much cash in USD we should end up with after it has all been exchanged.

We had a blissful time at Lake Yeak Laom in Ratanakiri, Cambodia and ended up with 2103942 riel left in our pocket.

We saw the best sunset of our lives in Hpa-an, Myanmar and left the country with 19092 kyat.

We got our fill of fjords in Bergen, Norway and discovered 109 krones that went unspent.

We soaked up the sun and history in Saranda, Albania and found 9094 lek scattered throughout our luggage when we arrived home to NYC.

The currency exchange business takes a flat $1 fee per conversion. Calculate our final amount of USD.
